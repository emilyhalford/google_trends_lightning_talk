This repo includes the code associated with my 09/01/2020 RLadiesNYC Lightning Talk. Unfortunately, the actual repo containing all of my work for the publication that I used this data for also includes confidential data and is therefore private. However, I have included code for constructing a sample ARIMA model with search data for "crisis text line" along with the code that I presented during my talk. 

The slides from my talk can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LTzvQsnTNtSAeGshRt_4eB32bggeIZdCVJaIwp0LGlg/edit?usp=sharing).
